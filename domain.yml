  - text: Avatars are virtual representations of a person.  Avatars lack any physical presence but instead exist only within a digital framework, such as within a video game or virtual reality environment. Unlike real people, avatars do not possess autonomy or free  will - they can only act on instructions that they are given by their creator or controller. As such, they cannot make independent decisions nor can they express emotion through body language like real people can.
